# About OpenMath

### What Is OpenMath?
OpenMath is a website dedicated to teaching mathematics from first principles. Most math courses will start by teaching what they deem to be "useful" math, which includes basic operations (+,-,/,\*), how to solve equations, and things such as "calculus". I, however, believe that while learning "useful" math can be useful, it would be nice if there was a way for people to learn the math that high school and early university won't teach. Over the course of the OpenMath program, you will learn about what it means to "do math", working from the ground up with axioms to define and structure the mathematics that we use in our day-to-day lives.
